# Title

There is a static website running within a container named `nautilus`, this container is running on `App Server 1`. Suddenly, we started facing some issues with the static website on `App Server 1`. Look into the issue to fix the same, you can find more details below:

1. Container's volume `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs` is mapped with the host's volume `/var/www/html`.
2. The website should run on host port `8080` on `App Server 1` i.e command `curl http://localhost:8080/` should work on `App Server 1`.

## SSH into App Server 1

```bash
ssh tony@172.16.238.10
```

## Run container with mappings

```bash
sudo docker run -d --name nautilus -p 8080:80 -v /var/www/html:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs httpd
```

## Verify if container is mapped and running

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/
```
